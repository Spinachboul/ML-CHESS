This is project for CHESS where using AI (Artificial Intelligence) , I have created a chess engine , the ones we use in chess apps.
This engine plays against the human brain while predicting 2-3 ahead of the other player
This was fun building where I learnt a lot of concepts and algorithms
This uses "Greedy Algorithms" concept which makes sure it is optimizing every move it makes against the next player.
